Project Title : Customer Segmentation and Analysis

Objective
The project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using the Mall Customers dataset. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to enable targeted marketing strategies.

Methodology
Data Exploration: Initial dataset understanding through summary statistics and data visualization.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, standardizing numerical features, and selecting relevant features for clustering.

Clustering Analysis:
K-means Clustering: Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and applied K-means to segment customers.
DBSCAN Clustering: Used for comparison to identify noise and core samples.
Visualization: Created scatter plots to visualize customer segments and their characteristics.
Segment Profiling: Analyzed mean values of key features within each segment to interpret customer groups.

Results
The project successfully identified distinct customer segments, providing insights into customer behavior patterns and potential marketing strategies.

Tools and Libraries
Python: Programming language used for analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For clustering algorithms.

Conclusion
The customer segmentation analysis effectively grouped customers based on their purchasing behaviors, enabling a deeper understanding of distinct customer profiles. This segmentation allows for more targeted and effective marketing strategies, enhancing customer engagement and business outcomes.
